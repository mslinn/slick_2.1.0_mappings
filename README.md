# Slick 2.1.0 Type Mapping Adventures #

This project illustrates the issue described in [Slick 2.1.0: No matching Shape found for mapped type](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28408343) on StackOverflow.

I found some information in [activator-hello-slick](https://github.com/typesafehub/activator-hello-slick/blob/slick-2.1).
Unfortunately the example deals in tuples, not instances of the persisted classes.

I think this approach is a good combination of the above.
