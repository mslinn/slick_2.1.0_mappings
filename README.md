# Slick 2.1.0 Problem #

This project illustrates the issue described in
[Slick 2.1.0: No matching Shape found for mapped type](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36976156/slick-2-1-0-no-matching-shape-found-for-mapped-type)
on StackOverflow.

I compiles now!

I found some information in [activator-hello-slick](https://github.com/typesafehub/activator-hello-slick/blob/slick-2.1).
Unfortunately the example deals in tuples, not instances of the persisted classes.

I think this approach is a good combination of the above.
